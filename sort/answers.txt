sort1 uses: TODO
This is a buble sort algotithm

How do you know?: TODO
This algorithm sorted the sorted array faster then sort 3 algorithm - Ω(n).

sort2 uses: TODO
This is a merge sort algorithm

How do you know?: TODO
It is the fastiest algorithm for random data compared to sort 1 and sort 3 algorithms. It has O(n logn) and Ω(n log n).

sort3 uses: TODO
This is a selection sort algorithm

How do you know?: TODO
It takes the longest time to sort sorted array - Ω(n^2).
