sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: This algorithm sorted the sorted array faster then sort 3 algorithm - Ω(n).

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It is the fastiest algorithm for random data compared to sort 1 and sort 3 algorithms. It has O(n logn) and Ω(n log n).

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It takes the longest time to sort sorted array - Ω(n^2).
