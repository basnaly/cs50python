                <div>There are a lot of types of public transportation in Nagoya.</div>
                <div>
                  <strong>Nagoya City Bus.</strong>
                  The city bus network reaches all parts of Nagoya city with the two biggest bus terminals at
                  Nagoya Station and Sakae Station (Oasis 21). Smaller bus stops can be found all over the city.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>Meguru Sightseeing Route Bus.</strong>

                  and Technology, Nagoya Castle, and the Tokugawa Art Museum and Garden. It also passes through
                  Sakae and along lesser-known spots in Nagoya.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>The Subway in Nagoya.</strong>
                  Subways might just be the most convenient and easiest way to get around Nagoya. There are 6 subway lines:
                  <ul class="m-0">
                    <li>Higashiyama Line (yellow)</li>
                    <li>Sakuradori Line (red)</li>
                    <li>Meijo Line and Meiko Line (purple)</li>
                    <li>Tsurumai Line (blue)</li>
                    <li>Kamiida Line (pink)</li>
                  </ul>
                  Meijo Line is a loop connecting all the other lines, and there are many options to transfer between the
                  lines to get to your destination as quickly as possible.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>The Aonami Line</strong> runs between Nagoya Station and Kinjo-Futo Station where Legoland Japan,
                  SCMaglev Rail Park, and Sealife are located. The whole line is 15 kilometers long and it takes 24 minutes
                  to go from one end to the other.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>The Yutorito Line</strong> runs from Ozone Station to Nakashidami/Kozoji. Interesting about this
                  line is the fact that it is a bus route with a guideway bus system operating on elevated tracks in the city
                  center, and functioning as a normal bus in less congested areas.

                particular wooden container called "ohitsu," and the eel fillets are finely cut in small strips and then placed
                over sauce-coated rice for a luxurious finish.
              </div>
              <div><strong>Tenmusu.</strong>
                This local delicacy is a type of onigiri filled with shrimp tempura and then wrapped in seaweed. The tempura
                usually peek out of the rice ball, and they are often served with butterbur stalks cooked in soy sauce.
              </div>
              <div><strong>Kishimen.</strong>
                Kishimen are a type of udon noodles.  Just like regular udon, kishimen can be enjoyed in hot soup with a variety
                of toppings or cold and served with a dipping sauce.
              </div>
              <div><strong>Miso Katsu.</strong>
                Fried foods topped with savory miso sauce is a Nagoya specialty. In Nagoya, they use a special type of miso called
                "Hatcho miso", which is a red type of miso produced in Aichi Prefecture. This unique miso is solely made from soybeans
                that are fermented for up to 2 to 3 years, and it has been produced in the same way since the Edo Period.
              </div>
              <div><strong>Cochin (Nagoya Chicken).</strong>
                Nagoya cochin is a local variety of premium chicken specifically grown in the Nagoya region, and is the most famous
                chicken produced in Japan.
              </div>
              <div><strong>Ebi Furai at Maruha Shokudo or Ebidote Shokudo.</strong>
                The world's longest shrimp is consistently more than 30 centimeters long and really consists of only a single animal.
                Surprisingly, this gigantic deep-fried shrimp is not only incredibly big but also particularly delicious, especially
                if it is paired with the handmade tartar sauce.
              </div>
              <div>There are many different and very special dishes in Nagoya, that I'm looking forward to taste!</div>
